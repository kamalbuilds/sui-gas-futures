Abhishek's expertise in React and Next.js will ensure that the Gas Futures platform is accessible and easy to use for both individual users and businesses.

## Budget

| Amount | Use |
|--------|-----|
| $35,000 | Development of smart contracts and backend infrastructure (US-based, 2 developers for 3 months) |
| $20,000 | Frontend development and user experience design (India-based, 2 developers for 3 months) |
| $25,000 | Security audits and testing (External audit firm) |
| $10,000 | Deployment, hosting, and operational costs |
| $10,000 | Documentation and community education |
| **$100,000** | **Total** |

## Other Funding Sources

We have received a $25,000 grant from the Sui Foundation's Developer Program to support the initial research and development of the Gas Futures concept. This funding has been used to create the initial prototype and conduct market research.

## Long-term Plan

To ensure the sustainability of the Gas Futures platform, we plan to implement the following:

1. **Revenue Model**: The platform will charge a small fee (0.1%) on each gas futures contract purchased, which will be used to maintain and improve the platform.

2. **Community Governance**: We will establish a DAO to govern the platform, allowing users to vote on important decisions such as fee adjustments and feature additions.

3. **Integration with DeepBook**: By integrating with Sui's DeepBook, we will create a liquid market for gas futures, ensuring that users can always find counterparties for their trades.

4. **Risk Management Fund**: A portion of the fees collected will be allocated to a risk management fund, which will be used to ensure the platform can meet its future gas obligations even in extreme market conditions.

5. **Ongoing Development**: We will maintain a dedicated team to continue developing and improving the platform, with a focus on adding new features and addressing user feedback.

6. **Open Source Contribution**: The core smart contracts will be open-sourced, allowing the community to audit and contribute to the codebase, ensuring its long-term viability.
