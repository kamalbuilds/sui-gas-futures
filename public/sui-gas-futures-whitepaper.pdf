## 1. Introduction

Blockchain networks experience fluctuating transaction costs based on network congestion, system upgrades, and market dynamics. For businesses and developers building on these networks, unpredictable gas prices introduce financial uncertainty and complicate user experience design. Sui Gas Futures leverages the unique capabilities of the Sui blockchain to create a futures market for gas fees, allowing users to lock in transaction costs regardless of future market conditions.

## 2. Market Problem

Gas price volatility creates several challenges in the blockchain ecosystem:

- **Unpredictable Operating Costs**: Businesses cannot accurately forecast their transaction costs, complicating budgeting and financial planning.
- **User Experience Issues**: Applications may need to pass unexpected gas cost increases to users, creating friction and reducing adoption.
- **Transaction Timing Risk**: Users may delay transactions during high gas price periods, potentially missing critical opportunities.
- **Development Uncertainty**: Developers must build complex gas estimation systems that can still fail during network congestion.

These challenges are particularly evident during periods of high network activity, when gas prices can spike by multiples of their baseline cost. For the Sui ecosystem to achieve mainstream adoption, these financial uncertainties must be addressed.

## 3. The Sui Gas Futures Solution

Sui Gas Futures provides a comprehensive solution to gas price volatility through:

- **Gas Credit Contracts**: Users purchase gas credits at a fixed price for a specific duration (30, 60, or 90 days), which are automatically applied to their transactions.
- **Futures Marketplace**: A decentralized exchange where users can trade gas futures contracts, creating liquidity and price discovery.
- **Risk Management Framework**: A system that ensures the platform remains solvent and can honor all gas credit obligations even in extreme market conditions.
- **Transparent Pricing Model**: Contract prices are algorithmically determined based on current gas prices, historical volatility, and risk parameters.

By implementing these components on the Sui blockchain, Sui Gas Futures creates a stable gas price environment that benefits all ecosystem participants.

## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1 Smart Contract Design

The platform is built using two primary Move modules:

1. **GasCredit Module**: Manages the creation, tracking, and redemption of gas credits.
2. **GasFuturesMarket Module**: Facilitates the trading of gas futures contracts between users.

The platform leverages Sui's object-centric model, where gas credits are represented as digital objects owned by users. These objects contain all the necessary metadata about the credit, including its locked price, total credit amount, used amount, and expiration date.

### 4.2 Gas Credit System

The Gas Credit system implements the following key functionality:

- **Credit Purchase**: Users can purchase gas credits at a fixed price for a specific duration.
- **Automatic Redemption**: When a user with active gas credits initiates a transaction, the system automatically applies those credits to cover the gas fees.
- **Expiration Mechanism**: Credits have a predefined expiration date, after which they can no longer be used.
- **Transparent Tracking**: Users can monitor their credit usage and remaining balances through the platform interface.

The system is designed to be gas-efficient itself, minimizing the overhead cost of using gas credits for transactions.

### 4.3 Futures Marketplace

The Futures Marketplace enables:

- **Order Creation**: Users can create buy or sell orders for gas futures with specific prices, amounts, and durations.
- **Order Matching**: The system matches compatible buy and sell orders, facilitating trades between users.
- **Escrow System**: Buy orders are backed by escrowed SUI tokens to ensure trade settlement.
- **Order Book**: A transparent view of all active orders, providing market depth information.

## 5. Economic Model

### 5.1 Pricing Mechanism

Gas futures contract prices are determined by:

- **Current Gas Price**: The baseline for pricing is the current reference gas price on the Sui network.
- **Historical Volatility**: Contracts incorporate a risk premium based on historical gas price volatility.
- **Duration Premium**: Longer duration contracts include additional premium to account for increased uncertainty.
- **Market Demand**: Supply and demand in the futures marketplace influences the effective price of contracts.

The initial implementation uses the following simplified pricing model:
- 30-day contracts: 0.00022 SUI per gas unit (typically below current price)
- 60-day contracts: 0.00023 SUI per gas unit
- 90-day contracts: 0.00024 SUI per gas unit

### 5.2 Fee Structure

The platform implements a sustainable fee model:

- **Platform Fee**: 0.1% on gas credit purchases, used to maintain the platform and fund development.
- **Trading Fee**: 0.2% on futures marketplace trades, split between platform treasury and risk fund.
- **Risk Fund Allocation**: 10% of all fees are directed to the risk management fund.

### 5.3 Risk Management Fund

To ensure the platform can fulfill its obligations even during extreme gas price fluctuations, the Risk Management Fund:

- Accumulates a portion of all platform fees
- Provides liquidity for gas credit redemption during price spikes
- Is governed by smart contract rules that prioritize platform solvency
- Operates with transparent reserve ratios visible to all users

## 6. Implementation Details
